<h1>Matt Bullard's Homepage</h1>
</p>I waas born on February 7th, 2000 with left-sided hemplegia which affects the left side of my body. People tend to think this limits what I can accomplish. However, I've played soccer, basketball, baseball, and I am currently on the club ultimate frisbee team at Umaine,I have acted and directed many plays and I've have climbed the two highest mountains in Maine, and plan to hike the Appalachain Trail after college. I did a camp called Leaders School through the YMCA and was nominated for the fellowship cup which is the highest honor a camper can recieve. I've volunteered with multiple community organizations and done everything from make a walking trail to cooking breakfeast for veterans omn veterans day. I like to think I have defied the odds in the best possible way.
